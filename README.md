## 🔍 Key Insights from Analysis

### 🛰 Orbital Path
- The module transitioned from an **Earth orbit of 170 x 36500 km** to a **100 x 100 km lunar polar orbit**.

### 📆 Mission Lifespan
- Supports lander and rover deployment.
- Continues to operate payloads for **3 to 6 months** post-deployment.

### ⚙️ Structure
- Based on the **I-3K satellite bus** — known for modularity, reliability, and wide use in ISRO missions.

### ⚖️ Mass Details
- **Dry Mass**: 448.62 kg (includes structural components and pressurants)  
- **Propellant Mass**: 1696.39 kg  
- **Total Mass**: 2145.01 kg  
- Nearly **79%** of the total mass is fuel — highlighting energy-intensive orbital maneuvers.

### 🔋 Power System
- Generates **738 W** of power, optimized for solar operation during **summer solstice** with attitude bias.

### 📡 Communication
- Uses **S-Band Transponder** (TTC), linked to the **Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN)** for mission tracking and telemetry.

### 🎯 Attitude & Navigation Sensors
- Equipped with:
  - **CASS** (Coarse Analog Sun Sensor)
  - **IRAP** (Infrared Earth Sensor)
  - **Micro Star Sensor**
- Enables accurate orientation, sun tracking, and attitude correction.

### 💥 Propulsion Technology
- Utilizes a **bi-propellant system (MMH + MON3)**, providing reliability, efficiency, and storability in deep-space missions.
